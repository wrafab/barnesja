	<h2> 3D Printing </h2>
		<h3> This Rotation was dedicated to learning CAD (Computer Aided Design).  Using Autodesk Fusion 360,  I designed a wax seal to be 3D printed </h3>
		<h3> I had difficulty using the software at first, but it got easier as I used it more.  I am by no means an expert but tasks such as navigating, </h3>
		<h3> designing, and placing things have gotten easier.  Things such as placing a circle where I needed it became far easier as I worked with the </h3>
		<h3> program </h3>

		<h3> Pictured above are two pictures showing the design on the computer and te design being exported.  However, when the print completed I realized </h3>
		<h3> I forgot to make the stamp a mirror so it would stamp in a readable fashion.  I then adjusted my design to fix this error. </h3>
