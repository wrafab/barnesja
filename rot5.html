	<h3> This rotation we began working with 3D priting and scanning.  The first project (shown below) is a model of my head placed upon a pedestal.  Someone scanned my head </h3>
	<h3> using a device with an Xbox Kinect on it.  I then moved the file to my computer and began what would be a tedious learning process.  Meshmixer was, by no means, an </h3>
	<h3 intuitive program.  I struggled with even basic tasks such as moving the different objects.  I finally was able to merge the 3D model of my head with a model of a pedestal. </h3>
	<h3> that I pulled off of thingiverse. </h3>

	<h3> The next project was to created an object that could be 3D printing additively but not subtractively.  In other words, make a hollow object, because it is impossible to carve </h3>
	<h3> an object out of something if the object is hollow.  The design process was not very hard, as I already have had experience using Fusion 360.  However, I did run into some issues when </h3>
	<h3> when trying to print because I had the wrong type of file at first.  The final project is shown below </h3>

	<h3> The final project to work on was a drip for a water bottle to screw into.  My first print was a hair too small and did not fit the bottle, however, it did drip nicely. My next </h3>
	<h3> attempt was to make it a little bigger.  Some limitations of the 3D printer are that they do not precisely print what I need.  For example, they print small holes poorly. </h3>
