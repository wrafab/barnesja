	<h3> This rotation we began working with 3D priting and scanning.  The first project (shown below) is a model of my head placed upon a pedestal.  Someone scanned my head </h3>
	<h3> using a device with an Xbox Kinect on it.  I then moved the file to my computer and began what would be a tedious learning process.  Meshmixer was, by no means, an </h3>
	<h3 intuitive program.  I struggled with even basic tasks such as moving the different objects.  I finally was able to merge the 3D model of my head with a model of a pedestal </h3>
	<h3> that I pulled off of thingiverse. </h3>
