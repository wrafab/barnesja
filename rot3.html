		<h2> T-Shirt Printing </h2>
			<h3> This week, we started by working with printing t-shirts.  I made a design on good drawings and then, using Corel Draw, converted it into a GT-3 file. </h3>
			<h3> Pictured below is the final result. </h3>

			<h2> UV Printing </h2>
			<h3> The UV printer is a machine that uses UV light to cure ink on a surface.  It is a very cheap printer to run, but there are some disadvantages.  </h3>
			<h3> These include: high startup costs, hard to clean up ink, and the ink can cause irritation </h3>

			<h3> The next project I worked on was a puzzle.  I made a design on Google Draw, and then I printed it on the UV printer.  Shown below is my design. </h3>
			<h3> I had some initial difficulty, because I had not used the printer before.  These design was not difficult. </h3>
