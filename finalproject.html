	<h3> This rotation we worked on a final project.  We were given the choice to make whatever we wanted using 4 or more prcoesses.  I chose to make my initials with 3D letters that have LEDs in them </h3>
	<h3> I started by using corel draw to make the letters.  I used the line tool to make the 2D cut of my initials.  I tested a couple designs using cardboard and once I got what I wanted I went back to </h3>
	<h3> went back to CorelDraw. </h3>

	<h3> I made two of each letter in my intials for the two faces, and I made shapes in them so the lights could shine through. </h3>

	<h3> I then printed rectangles for all the edges of the letters to make them 3D. </h3>

	<h3> Next step was to make the 3D printed bases for the letters.  I did not correctly size one of the bases at first. </h3>
