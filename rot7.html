  <h1> Rotation 7 </h1>
		<h2> Creating a Skateboard </h2>
			<br></br>
		<h3> This rotation we worked on designing, laminating, and vacuum forming skateboards.  I used CorelDraw to create a design for the bottom of my board.  Then, using the laser printer, I rastered the design onto a sheet of wood. </h3>
<h3> Then it was time to assemble the board The process began with 1/16 inch wood sheets.  The sheets were ordered by their seam direction in order to provide the board strength and flexibilty needed for a good board. </h3>
<h3> After that, we took the sheets and laminated them together by pouring a glue onto the surface then spreading it with a roller.  The process was then repeated with all the sheets being stacked on one another </h3>
<h3> Once the pieces were laminated together, we put the board on top of a piece of styrofoam that would be used for molding the board into the proper shape.  The two parts were then put into an airtight bag with a strip </h3>
<h3> of mesh called a breather in between the board and the valve.  The bag was sealed with a strip of tar and we began to use a pump to take out the air.  Once the pump began clicking, we stopped pumping and left the </h3>
<h3> board to sit for 24 hours.  When I took mine out, it was slightly misshapen due to mistake in positioning the board on the styrofoam.  I sanded down the edges of my board in order to make them a bit cleaner looking </h3>
<h3> After I had sanded the faces of the board, I spray painted the top.  After the paint had dried, I applied a protective layer to keep the board looking good even after use </h3>
