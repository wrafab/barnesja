		<h3> This was a challenge where our team was given tape, string, straws, and a cup and we were told to suspend </h3>
		<h3> the cup using the string.  The goal was to hold as many pennies as we could.  We held the second most of </h3>
		<h3> the groups that were not disqualified.  The design failed, however, because of our lack of triangles and </h3>
		<h3> the fact that it was too tall and not compact. </h3>
