		<h2> My Approach </h2>
		<br></br>
		<h3> My approach to this class is to jump into the project with whatever instruction Mr. Gerber gives me.  I will probably </h3>
	<h3> fail, at which point I will look up a video or google a solution to my problem. </h3>

		<h3> This was a challenge where our team was given tape, string, straws, and a cup and we were told to suspend </h3>
		<h3> the cup using the string.  The goal was to hold as many pennies as we could.  We held the second most of </h3>
		<h3> the groups that were not disqualified.  The design failed, however, because of our lack of triangles and </h3>
		<h3> the fact that it was too tall and not compact.  My contributions to the project were to suggest the idea </h3>
		<h3> of placing one straw inside another to link them together </h3>
