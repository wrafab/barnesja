	<h3> One project I did with vinyl cutting was making single color stickers.  These sticks are shapes that are cut by a Roland GS-24 on a single color piece of vinyl that is sticky on one side.  I made </h3>
	<h3> each sticker by choosing an image online.  Each image that I found was a simple shape that could be cut and then peeled off without damageing the sticker.  I put each image side by side in a CorelDraw </h3>
	<h3> document.  I saved it to a flash drive and went to the computer by the printer where I outlined it as a logo, ungrouped it, then I clicked the R icon to cut it.  The most challenging part of the process </h3>
	<h3> was remembering the small steps after placing the images in the CorelDraw document. </h3>
	<h3> I chose the stickers I did because I like baseball, and more specifically the Indians thus the "C") and I like the ocean so I made an anchor. </h3>
