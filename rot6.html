	<h3> One project I did with vinyl cutting was making single color stickers.  These sticks are shapes that are cut by a Roland GS-24 on a single color piece of vinyl that is sticky on one side.  I made </h3>
	<h3> each sticker by choosing an image online.  Each image that I found was a simple shape that could be cut and then peeled off without damageing the sticker.  I put each image side by side in a CorelDraw </h3>
	<h3> document.  I saved it to a flash drive and went to the computer by the printer where I outlined it as a logo, ungrouped it, then I clicked the R icon to cut it.  The most challenging part of the process </h3>
	<h3> was remembering the small steps after placing the images in the CorelDraw document. </h3>
	<h3> I chose the stickers I did because I like baseball, and more specifically the Indians thus the "C") and I like the ocean so I made an anchor. </h3>

	<h3> I went through a similar process for color stickers.  I found an image and made it the dimensions that I wanted.  Then, I outlined it with the Roland pink contour line and printed them both. </h3>

	<h3> After the stickers, I moved on to making a coaster out of urethane and epoxy.  The bottom of the coaster was made out of urethane.  The top was made out of epoxy, and in between I put a key.  The first step </h3>
	<h3> was to mix materials to get the urethane mixture.  I then added blue dye while stirring.  Using a slow and high pour, I slowly drizzled the material out of a paper cup and into a wider, plastic one. The next </h3>
	<h3> was to create the top layer.  After the bottom had set for 24 hours, I made another mixture.  After hot gluing my key to the bottom layer, I poured the epoxy mixture into the cup as well.  I used a popsicle </h3>
	<h3> stick to move the bubbles that were fromed to the side.  I let the top layer set for 24 hours as well.  The final project is shown below. </h3>
